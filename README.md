# Person-of-Interest-Identifier-
This project is based on the Enron scandal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) of 2001, the data used here is the email 
and financial data of enron which was made public and can be found here (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tar.gz). 
Here we identify people from the numerous enron employees which can be considered as 'person of interest (poi)' i.e. who may have a 
hand in the scandal. The data has handpicked people classified as poi which were convicted in reality. We use a supervised learning 
approach to build our poi identifier.
